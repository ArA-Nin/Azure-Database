# Azure-Database

Hi! 

This is a basic repository that holds an ARM script that can creat a database and a vm that connects to said db, furthermore the database has some simple tables that mimics a dvd retail store and the VM stores a webpage that connects to the database and displays the sales and inventory of the dvd store.

Hope that can be of use for you.
